phdthesis in bib
 
  
  *   “will be” > “is” or “are” in reference to material covered in future sections in the book.
  
  * One proofreader prompted me to change single quotations to double quotations in the prose in all cases except for when glosses/translations were cited. I did so; however, there are probably many more cases in the text where I used single quotations and other proofreaders did not comment. This should be consistent throughout.

  *   One proofreader pointed out that I sometimes use “we” when I mean “I”. There are probably many more cases of this in the text, which ought to be corrected.
  
  *   One proofreader asked me to change special terms which were given in italics to terms in quotations. I did so for a few where it was appropriate, but probably there are more throughout the text which other proofreaders did not note. Is there a way to see all italicized items in the document?
