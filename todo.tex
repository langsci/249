  *   “Serbia and Montenegro” > “Serbia, Montenegro” throughout the text, including Appendices.
  *   Remove commas after “e.g.” and “i.e.” throughout.
  *   “will be” > “is” or “are” in reference to material covered in future sections in the book.
  * One proofreader prompted me to change single quotations to double quotations in the prose in all cases except for when glosses/translations were cited. I did so; however, there are probably many more cases in the text where I used single quotations and other proofreaders did not comment. This should be consistent throughout.
  *   In replacing single quotations with double quotations in Chapters 1 and 2, I may have used the wrong quotations (straight rather than slanted).
  *   One proofreader pointed out that I sometimes use “we” when I mean “I”. There are probably many more cases of this in the text, which ought to be corrected.
  *   One proofreader asked me to change special terms which were given in italics to terms in quotations. I did so for a few where it was appropriate, but probably there are more throughout the text which other proofreaders did not note. Is there a way to see all italicized items in the document?
